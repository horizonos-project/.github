# Welcome to the HorizonOS Project 🌌

HorizonOS is an experimental operating system developed from the ground up for the x86 (i386) architecture.

## 🚀 What is HorizonOS?

HorizonOS is a ground-up OS project that explores:
- **Kernel development** for x86 architecture
- **Custom toolchain** and build systems tailored for OS development
- **Systems programming** fundamentals without the abstractions
- **Educational exploration** of operating system internals

## 📦 What's Inside

This organization hosts:
- **The OS itself** - Core kernel, drivers, and system components
- **Custom tooling** - Specialized tools built specifically for Horizon development
- **OS-Specific Applications** - Additional utilies built for Horizon
- **Build infrastructure** - Everything needed to compile and test the OS
- **Documentation** - Guides, specs, and notes from the trenches

## 🛠️ Current Status

HorizonOS is in **active development**. This is an experimental project, which means things break, get rebuilt, and evolve rapidly. This goes for the tools as well, this ecosystem is always growing and evolving.

> [!CAUTION]
> This operating system is not yet at a state where it can be used for daily use. This system is also not tested on real hardware.
